# ChatServer
!!!!!Please don't worry about it, these are machine translation (except at the beginning of your shit)
!!!!!!!!!!!!

A chat server and client(Again, I am a middle school student)

use in lan

My original intention is to chat smoothly in computer class

And, my English isn't well(I'm a Chinese)

There is nothing special about this server

All you have to do is double-click to open

This server provides several useful commands:

ban:(Kick out IP and prevent reconnection)


usage:ban [ip]

2：un_ban：
usage：un_ban [baned ip]
3:show_baned:
usage:show_baned

---------seq--------------------

Update 1: reduce the risk of unable to receive new messages (but it will happen, just probability is small, so I suggest that every message sent twice as much as possible)

Update 2:Each message sent by default twice, after receiving the message server if the same two messages will send one to the client, otherwise the first sent to the client.


The server will print  before 20 characters of a problem message


Update3 : 
I found that sometimes the message will not receive, so each message will send six times between the server and the client
When new users to connect server will be broadcast

Also changed some logical mistakes
