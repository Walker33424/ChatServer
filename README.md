# ChatServer
!!!!!Please don't worry about it, these are machine translation (except at the beginning of your shit)
!!!!!!!!!!!!
A chat server and client(Again, I am a middle school student)
use in lan
My original intention is to chat smoothly in computer class
And, my English isn't well(I'm a Chinese)
There is nothing special about this server
All you have to do is double-click to open
This server provides several useful commands:
ban:(Kick out IP and prevent reconnection)
usage:ban [ip]
2：un_ban：
usage：un_ban [baned ip]
3:show_baned:
usage:show_baned
---------seq--------------------
Update 1: reduce the risk of unable to receive new messages (but it will happen, just probability is small, so I suggest that every message sent twice as much as possible)
