# ChatServer
!!!!!Please don't worry about it, these are machine translation (except at the beginning of your shit)
!!!!!!!!!!!!

A chat server and client(Again, I am a middle school student)

use in lan

That MP3 is used to test the upload and download functions

My original intention is to chat smoothly in computer class


And, my English isn't well(I'm a Chinese)

There is nothing special about this server

All you have to do is double-click to open

This server provides several useful commands:

ban:(Kick out IP and prevent reconnection)


usage:ban [ip]

2：un_ban：
usage：un_ban [baned ip]
3:show_baned:
usage:show_baned

---------seq--------------------

Update 1: reduce the risk of unable to receive new messages (but it will happen, just probability is small, so I suggest that every message sent twice as much as possible)

Update 2:Each message sent by default twice, after receiving the message server if the same two messages will send one to the client, otherwise the first sent to the client.


The server will print  before 20 characters of a problem message


Update3 : 
I found that sometimes the message will not receive, so each message will send six times between the server and the client
When new users to connect server will be broadcast

Also changed some logical mistakes


Update4:

Add the scrollbar and Delete all message button, used for pulling all chat message box, and Delete all chat message box content

Provide lower resolution to use client - if your resolution is very low or in the laptop


Update4.5 2020/1/11 18:50 Beijing


Submitted by the client is not completed! Because I can't find my U disk, found now, at once uploaded

Update5:
!!!!!You can upload files!
But there is a small limitation, file name must be ASCII characters. Otherwise the server will ignore your upload

Updata6:
Fixed some bugs

Upload file name supports UTF-8 encoding

Update7:
Add logging system

I got a strange email：
"""
Hello!

I am a hacker who has access to your operating system.
I also have full access to your account.

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks.
I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this,
transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  18CyG7tbZypAQCQ25Y3HMLjLMFD9y7hZSN

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.
I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

Best regards!

Fool, China can't visit Google, and I've never visited any adult websites
